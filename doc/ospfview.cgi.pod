=head1 NAME

B<ospfview.cgi> - publish the OSPF LSDB graph on a web server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/ospfview.cgi?ipv6=0&external=2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The cgi script B<ospfview.cgi> allows to publish the link-state
database of an OSPF router on a web server running there.

The router must run the OpenBSD B<ospfd> or B<ospf6d> routing daemon.
To make this cgi script work, the web server must have access to
the F</var/run/ospfd.sock> and F</var/run/ospf6d.sock> UNIX domain
sockets.
This can be achieved by file permissions or B<sudo> permissions for
B<ospfctl> and B<ospf6ctl>.
The web server must not run chrooted.

The following parameters control the format and content of the
generated graph.
The content parameters have numerical values, C<0> disables the
feature and is the default.

=over 4

=item format

Specify the file format of the generated image.
The value is passed to the B<dot> B<-T> option.
Available choices are C<dot>, C<fig>, C<gif>, C<pdf>, C<png>, C<ps>,
C<ps2>, C<svg>, C<svgz>.
Default is C<svg>.

=item ipv6

The value C<1> turns on IPv6, C<0> uses IPv4.

=item legend

The value C<1> displays the legend instead of the current OSPF LSDB.

=item summary

The value C<1> adds the network summary-LSAs to the graph.
With C<2> these LSAs get aggregated.
Inter-area-prefix-LSAs have not been implemented for IPv6.

=item boundary

The value C<1> adds the boundary router summary-LSAs to the graph.
With C<2> these LSAs get aggregated.
Inter-area-router-LSAs have not been implemented for IPv6.

=item external

The value C<1> adds the AS-external-LSAs to the graph.
With C<2> these LSAs get aggregated.

=item link

The value C<1> adds the link-LSAs to the graph.
These LSAs exist only for IPv6.

=item intra

The value C<1> adds the network and router intra-area-prefix-LSAs
to the graph.
These LSAs exist only for IPv6.

=item cluster

The value C<1> clusters LSAs containing the same network into a
common rectangle.
This feature has not been implemented for IPv6.

=item warnings

The value C<1> prints the area and all warnings corresponding to
the color of the nodes and edges.
With C<2> only the area or the most severe warning is printed.
Note that with the C<svg> format, the messages are always available
as tool tip.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The program dies if an error occurs.
Check your web server's error log for messages.

=head1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

It is probably not the best idea to publish one's routing topology
on a public web server.
This cgi script is intended to debug OSPF in a controlled environment.

The perl taint mode is used to make this cgi script secure.
